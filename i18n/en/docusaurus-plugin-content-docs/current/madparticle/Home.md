Welcome to the MadParticle Guide!

---

Inspired by [Extinguish](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/extinguish-by-uss_shenzhou)'s showcase at [Teacon 2022](https://www.teacon.cn/2022/index), MadParticle is a mod primarily intended for multiplayer games and data packs. By creatively reusing existing particle textures rather than adding new ones, it provides nearly unlimited possibilities for particle effects in various scenarios.

MadParticle's design philosophy is based on the following principles:

- Maximizing the utilization of Minecraft's native command system for compatibility across versions or platforms, persistence, and ease of transfer.
- Avoiding the introduction of new artistic assets unless required for cross-platform needs.
- Maintaining a visual style that closely aligns with vanilla Minecraft.

The `/madparticle` command is the most essential feature of this mod. As foundational content, you should first thoroughly read the `/madparticle Command Guide`, then explore the use of the auxiliary design tools in the `Designer GUI Guide`, and finally review the remaining chapters.

Please note that MadParticle's primary purpose is to enhance particle effects in the game, with optimization features included as supplementary benefits.
